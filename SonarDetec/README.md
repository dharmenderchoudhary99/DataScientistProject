MINE ROCK PREDICTION

	This project aims to predict whether a rock is a mine or a rock using logistic regression. The data used in this project is from a sonar-data file, 
	which contains various features,data of rocks and their labels (mine or rock).

MODULES AND LIBRARIES ::-
	 1)	Pandas
	 2)Numpy
	 3)matplotlib
	 4)Sklearn (train_test_split,logisticregression,accuracy_score)

WE WILL NOW LOAD THE CSV FILE::-
		Load the csv file using the pandas

CHECK THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ROWS AND COLUMNS ::-
		check the total number of rows and columns in our csv file using the SHAPE, DESCRIBE function

NOW COUNTS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DATA ::-
		Now we will count the total number of data of mine and rock in our datasets

NOW WE WILL USE THE TRAIN TEST SPLIT ::-
		Now we will use the train_test_split function to split the data into train and test subset
		by providing test size(test_size=0.2) means 20% of our data we will be allocated for testing and 80% allocated for training

USING THE SHAPE FUNCTION ::-
		We can see how much data is allocated to training subste by using shape function(X_train.shape)

TRAIN OUR TRAINING DATA IN LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL ::-
		Train a logistic regression model on the training set using the LogisticRegression class from sklearn.linear_model

FIT METHOD ::-
		The fit() method is used to fit the model to the training data by adjusting its 
		parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual target values.

PREDICT METHOD	::-
		The predict() method takes the input features of the training set X_train as input and 
		generates predicted target values based on the learned model parameters.

PROVIDING THE DATA TO PREDICT THE MODEL ACCURACY ::-
		1)We will now provide a dataset to the model in an array(asarray()) to convert the datasets into 1 and 0
		2)The accuracy_score() method takes two parameters as input: y_true, which is the true target values of the test set, 
			and y_pred, which is the predicted target values generated by the model on the test set.
		3)Providing the datasets to model to predict that our model is 
			giving the correct  prediction that there is mine or rock
