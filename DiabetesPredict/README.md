DIABETES PREDICTION
    This project aims is to predict whether  a patient has diabetes or not using support vector machine. The data used in this project is a csv file ,
    name diabetes.csv which has 768 rows and 9 columns having data that represent us that what features should be there to check that
    a patient has diabetes or not
 
 MODULES AND LIBRARIES::- 
            1)Numpy
            2)Pandas
            3)sklearn(StandarScaler,train_test_spilt,svm,accuracy_score)
            
 
LOAD THE DATA::-
      Load the data using the pd.read_csv functtion to read the data 
     
CHECK THE ROWS AND COLUMNS::-
       Check the rows and columns and a outcome columns which will tell the data for diabetes or not
       
COUNT NUMBER OF DATA::-
        Count the total data featuring the data for diabetecs and for non diabetec using the (value_count()) function
 
SEPRATING THE DATA AND TABLE::-
        We will seprate our data shoeing the diabetec record
     
STANDARDIZATION OF DATA::-
        We will standardize our data using the StandardScaler() function
        
USING THE TEST TRAIN SPLIT FUNCTION::-
        Now we will split the data into train test data to trasin our model and after that we will test how much prediction is right
       
FIT METHOD ::-
        The fit() method is used to fit the model to the training data by,
        adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual target values.      


PREDICT METHOD ::- 
        The predict() method takes the input features of the training set X_train,
        as input and generates predicted target values based on the learned model parameters
         
ACCURACY_SCORE::-
        Accuracy score function tells that how much right prediction is done by our model
 
PROVIDING THE DATA TO PREDICT THE MODEL ACCURACY ::- 
        1)We will now provide a dataset to the model in an array(asarray()) to convert the datasets into 1 and 0 
        2)The accuracy_score() method takes two parameters as input: y_true, which is the true target values of the test set, and y_pred,
          which is the predicted target values generated by the model on the test set. 
        3)Providing the datasets to model to predict that our model is giving the correct prediction that patient is diabetecs or not
        4)We will print the statement using the if else loops
